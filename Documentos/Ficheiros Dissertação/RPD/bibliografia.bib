To support such growth, operators are aiming at lowering optical network costs by deploying multi-vendor disaggregated optical networks supporting white boxes while maintaining target performances. To make this effort successful, a vendor-agnostic assessment of optical performance is needed, and operators and vendors are working together to achieve this. In this paper, we present the vision of the Open Optical Packet Transport Physical Simulation Environment (PSE) Group of the Telecom Infra Project consortium, which aims at developing an open source framework for quality-of-transmission (QoT) assessment for design and operation of multi-vendor optical networks. We validate the PSE QoT estimator—the optical link emulator (OLE) based on the Gaussian noise (GN) model for nonlinear ﬁber propagation—by comparison with experimental results on the mixed-ﬁber test-bed network at Microsoft labs, operated in the C-band by commercial transceivers from eight different vendors, with propagation distances up to 1945 km. An excellent agreement between OLE predictions requiring milliseconds of computational time and measurements has been observed for all channels. The observed ±0.75 dB of accuracy in OLE predictions can be further reduced by including the stimulated Raman scattering in the GN model and with a more accurate capability to estimate power levels and the amount of ampliﬁed spontaneous emission noise. Further work will be also required to automate the measurement process of operational parameters from network equipment, especially optical ampliﬁers, to streamline the overall QoT estimation process.},

CAD files contain detail geometric information of a part. Different CAD software uses different types of databases to store the part information. There is no common structure of the databases and as such it is difficult, sometimes impossible to interpret or make any necessary change in the databases. In this work geometric information of a rotational part is translated into manufacturing information through a Data Interchange Format (DXF). A feature recognition algorithm is used to recognize different features of the part from its DXF file, where geometric information of the part is stored after respective DXF codes. Finally, using the data extracted from DXF file, each feature of the part is recognized.},

	abstract = {This paper surveys the implementation and deployment of fiber-to-the-x (FTTX) services and technologies in Indonesia. Motivation of this study is to provide the mapping report of Indonesian current status and to determine about the playing key role behind the growing of national information communication and technology (ICT). More of it is to leverage ICT infrastructures to be a robust ICT connectivity across the Indonesia archipelago which later on can be used for many diverse applications such as disaster resilience and sustainable development. In this survey we use the systematic literature review (SLR) method by gathering data from Internet (journal articles, paper conferences, and websites) as our (secondary) resources. From our survey we recognize that there are three main problems which can slow down the FTTX growth and implementation in Indonesia, namely geographical barrier, deployment cost, and goverment regulation. We also compared the Indonesia’s FTTX growth with several Asian countries such as China, India, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, and Philippines. From our findings, one of the best practices or lessons that we learn is that national governments must build the access to broadband or high-speed internet by owning the responsibilities for the infrastructures. By creating their own National Broadband Networks (NBNs) Plan, governments are hoping to bridge the digital divide, create employment and enhance the industrial productivity, and at the end to improve the overall economic development. In our point of view, cost estimation and techno-economic analysis is strongly related to the strategic network design.},

	abstract = {To ensure uninterrupted communication in optical transport networks, the common practice is to overprovision lightpaths in terms of capacity and physical layer performance. Overprovisioning at the physical layer is achieved using worst case assumptions and high margins in the estimation of the Quality of Transmission (QoT) when provisioning lightpaths. End-of-Life system margins are used to anticipate performance deteriorations due to additional future interference, ageing, and maintenance operations, while the design margin is used to account for inaccuracies in the QoT estimation. Such assumptions decrease network efﬁciency and increase the network cost. The advent of elastic optical networks and software deﬁned networking will enable a dynamically and adaptably operated optical network. We envision an optical network that continuously senses the physical layer and optimizes connections accordingly. This enables static (e.g., worst case) physical information to be replaced by the real-time (and accurate) information. We propose an algorithm that takes into account the actual physical layer performance to provision the lightpaths with actual (just enough) margins, optimizing the decisions regarding the placement and transmission parameters of transponders and regenerators including their launch powers. Using this algorithm in a multiperiod planning scenario, we quantify the cost beneﬁts of provisioning with actual margins as opposed to planning with worst case margins.},

We validate the PSE QoT estimator—the optical link emulator (OLE) based on the Gaussian noise (GN) model for nonlinear ﬁber propagation—by comparison with experimental results on the mixed-ﬁber test-bed network at Microsoft labs, operated in the C-band by commercial transceivers from eight different vendors, with propagation distances up to 1945 km. An excellent agreement between OLE predictions requiring milliseconds of computational time and measurements has been observed for all channels. The observed ±0.75 dB of accuracy in OLE predictions can be further reduced by including the stimulated Raman scattering in the GN model and with a more accurate capability to estimate power levels and the amount of ampliﬁed spontaneous emission noise. Further work will be also required to automate the measurement process of operational parameters from network equipment, especially optical ampliﬁers, to streamline the overall QoT estimation process.},

	abstract = {This paper explains manufacturing feature recognition of a rotational component using DXF file. Feature recognition integrates two independent systems: CAD and CAPP. CAD files contain detail geometric information of a part. Different CAD software uses different types of databases to store the part information. There is no common structure of the databases and as such it is difficult, sometimes impossible to interpret or make any necessary change in the databases. In this work geometric information of a rotational part is translated into manufacturing information through a Data Interchange Format (DXF). A feature recognition algorithm is used to recognize different features of the part from its DXF file, where geometric information of the part is stored after respective DXF codes. Finally, using the data extracted from DXF file, each feature of the part is recognized.},

	abstract = {This paper surveys the implementation and deployment of fiber-to-the-x (FTTX) services and technologies in Indonesia. Motivation of this study is to provide the mapping report of Indonesian current status and to determine about the playing key role behind the growing of national information communication and technology (ICT). More of it is to leverage ICT infrastructures to be a robust ICT connectivity across the Indonesia archipelago which later on can be used for many diverse applications such as disaster resilience and sustainable development. In this survey we use the systematic literature review (SLR) method by gathering data from Internet (journal articles, paper conferences, and websites) as our (secondary) resources. From our survey we recognize that there are three main problems which can slow down the FTTX growth and implementation in Indonesia, namely geographical barrier, deployment cost, and goverment regulation. We also compared the Indonesia’s FTTX growth with several Asian countries such as China, India, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, and Philippines. From our findings, one of the best practices or lessons that we learn is that national governments must build the access to broadband or high-speed internet by owning the responsibilities for the infrastructures. By creating their own National Broadband Networks (NBNs) Plan, governments are hoping to bridge the digital divide, create employment and enhance the industrial productivity, and at the end to improve the overall economic development. In our point of view, cost estimation and techno-economic analysis is strongly related to the strategic network design.},

Focusing on the optical transport and switching layer, we cover aspects of large-scale spatial multiplexing, massive opto-electronic arrays and holistic optics-electronics-DSP integration, as well as optical node architectures for switching and multiplexing of spatial and spectral superchannels.},

	abstract = {To ensure uninterrupted communication in optical transport networks, the common practice is to overprovision lightpaths in terms of capacity and physical layer performance. Overprovisioning at the physical layer is achieved using worst case assumptions and high margins in the estimation of the Quality of Transmission (QoT) when provisioning lightpaths. End-of-Life system margins are used to anticipate performance deteriorations due to additional future interference, ageing, and maintenance operations, while the design margin is used to account for inaccuracies in the QoT estimation. Such assumptions decrease network efﬁciency and increase the network cost. The advent of elastic optical networks and software deﬁned networking will enable a dynamically and adaptably operated optical network. We envision an optical network that continuously senses the physical layer and optimizes connections accordingly. This enables static (e.g., worst case) physical information to be replaced by the real-time (and accurate) information. We propose an algorithm that takes into account the actual physical layer performance to provision the lightpaths with actual (just enough) margins, optimizing the decisions regarding the placement and transmission parameters of transponders and regenerators including their launch powers. Using this algorithm in a multiperiod planning scenario, we quantify the cost beneﬁts of provisioning with actual margins as opposed to planning with worst case margins.},
